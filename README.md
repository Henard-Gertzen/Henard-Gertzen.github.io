# Documentation
- Hosting

  My website and virtual CV are hosted on GitHub pages.
- Innovation

  The tendency among standard website practices and design is to stick to 2d spaces or parallax effects to emulate 3d space. This was boring so I decided to introduce a 3d canvas into my webpage.
- Web Technology

  The technology used in my website is mostly React, React-Fiber, Babel, Tailwind and Vite. I decided to use [React Three](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) for the 3d canvas generation. I used a free model from a design website as the island and translated it to .glb files so that they can be used in the website.
- Compatibility

  My website is compatible with all devices I have tested it on.
- Navigation

  For navigation, I decided to add options on a carousel, which allows users to turn the 3d space and select options, for devices that cannot render the website a standard NavBar is added.
